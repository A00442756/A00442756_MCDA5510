I have been opportuned to visit some really spectacular places;
The most favourite being Madame Tussauds.

Madame Tussauds is a very popular tourist centre in London.
It houses hundreds of identical wax portraits of celebrities. These wax objects are barely distinguishable from the celebrity's face and features.
